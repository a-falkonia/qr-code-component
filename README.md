## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

For this Newbie project, I've tried to follow the BEM guidelines as well as i could.
This is my first ever component, so I'm pretty proud of it :)

I'm planning to make it a bit more clean and adaptive in the nearest future. 

### Useful resources

I've used the PerfectPixel Chrome extension to keep track of the paddings and font sizes
